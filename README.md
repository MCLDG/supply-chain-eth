# Supply Chain on blockchain
Build a supply chain application on Ethereum

## Getting started
Deploy Ethereum development dependencies:

Node.js
Truffle:
npm install -g truffle
Ganache (local Ethereum blockchain for testing):
https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache/releases
Select a release and scroll down to download the appropriate binary


Metamask extension for Chrome:

I've also added Solidity syntax highlighting to VSCode.

In a new directory for your application, initialise a new truffle project:

```
truffle init
```

Configure package.json with the appropriate packages, then install them:

```
npm install
```
